NAME
    Attribute::SubName - Naming anonymous subroutines via attributes

VERSION
    version 1.101420

SYNOPSIS
        use Attribute::SubName;
        my $coderef = sub :Name(foo) { print "got: $_\n"; };
        print foo("hi");

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an attribute ":Name" that you can use on anonymous
    subroutines to give them a name. This is useful as they will then show
    up with that name in stack traces (cf. Carp). The naming is done with
    Sub::Name. Additionally, the attribute also installs the newly named
    subroutine in the proper glob slot so you can refer to it by name.

INSTALLATION
